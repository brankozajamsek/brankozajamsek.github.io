I am an acoustical engineer currently working as a research associate on characterising the effects of noise on sleep and environmental sleep. I am interested in a wide range of topics most of which involve signal analysis, acoustic measurements and application of Bayesian
methods. See [here](../publications) for an overview of my scientific publications. You can also find me on
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?hl=en&user=k2uin0EAAAAJ). Originally, I have studied Acoustics at the University of Salford and did my PhD in Sydney at the University of New South Wales in Aeroacoustics. 

## Main Research Interests

* Bayesian Statistics
* Uncertainty Quantification
* Simulation-Based Inference
* Model Comparison
* Multilevel Modeling
* Environemtal noise
* Noise Source Localisation
* Numerical Noise Predictions

## Languages

* *R* (statistical computing)
* *Python*
* *Matlab*
* speaking Slovenian and English, and learning German and Italian for the fun of it
